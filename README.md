**Certificate App - React Frontend Implementation**

Welcome to the Certificate App project. In this project, I had the privilege of working on the front end implementation for DCCS Tuzla, a challenging yet rewarding experience.

The Certificate App exemplifies my commitment to learning and adapting to new technologies, as I tackled React for the first time.

I am excited to share this project with DCCS Tuzla, with the hope that it aligns with the company's goals.

Thank you for considering my Certificate App project, and I look forward to discussing it further with you
